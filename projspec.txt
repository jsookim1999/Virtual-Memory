Project Specifications

•Physical memory is an integer array PM[524288]
•The disk (when implementing demand paging) is an integer array D[1024][512]
•All VAs and PAs are integers•The size of s, p, and w is 9 bits each. 
•The VM manager initializes the PM from an input file consisting of 2 lines. 
    •Line 1 contains triples of integers, which define the contents of the ST
    •Line 2 contains triples of integers, which define the contents of the PTs
    •The initialization file is syntactically correct in that:
        •Line 1 correctly specifies 1 or more segment table entries
        •Line 2 correctly specifies 0 or more entries in PTs for the segments specified on line 1

•The VM manager then reads VAs from another input file, attempts to translate each into a PA, and write the results into an output file
•The basic version of the VM manager does not support demand paging and is worth 60% of the credit for the project
•The extended version of the VM manager must support demand paging and is worth 100% of the credit for the project
•For demand paging, the PM will always have a sufficient number of free frames available so that no page replacement algorithm is needed.

Simple test cases
Without demand paging:
    •The initialization file contains the 2 lines:
        6 3000 4
        6 5 9
    •The input file contains:1575424 1575863 1575864
    •The output file should contain:4608 5047 -1

With demand paging:
•The initialization file contains the 2 lines:
    8 4000 3 9 5000 -7      
    8 0 10 8 1 -20 9 0 13 9 1 -25
•That means, frames 0, 1, 3, 10, 13 are occupied. The following VA translations use the free frames 2, 4, 5 when a page fault occurs.
•The input file contains: 2097162 2097674 2359306 2359818
•The output file should contain:5130 1034 6666 2570
